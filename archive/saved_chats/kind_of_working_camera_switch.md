hmamawal: how would i implement a camera view change if i pressed 'C' where the camera would become the location of hte avatar object and if i pressed 'C' again then the camera view would switch back to normal?

GitHub Copilot: # Implementing Camera View Switching for Avatar

You can implement a camera view toggle where pressing 'C' switches between normal camera control and an avatar-based perspective. Here's how to add this functionality:

## 1. Add a State Variable to Track Camera Mode

First, add a global variable to track the current camera mode:

```cpp
// Add near the other global variables in main.cpp
bool avatar_camera_mode = false;
glm::vec3 saved_camera_position;
glm::vec3 saved_camera_front;
float saved_camera_yaw;
float saved_camera_pitch;
```

## 2. Modify the ProcessInput Function

Add logic to handle the 'C' key press in the ProcessInput function:

```cpp
void ProcessInput(GLFWwindow *window)
{
    // Existing code...

    // Toggle camera mode when 'C' is pressed
    static bool c_key_pressed = false;
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_C) == GLFW_PRESS) {
        if (!c_key_pressed) {
            avatar_camera_mode = !avatar_camera_mode;
            
            if (avatar_camera_mode) {
                // Switching to avatar view - save current camera state
                saved_camera_position = camera.Position;
                saved_camera_front = camera.Front;
                saved_camera_yaw = camera.Yaw;
                saved_camera_pitch = camera.Pitch;
            } else {
                // Switching back to normal view - restore camera state
                camera.Position = saved_camera_position;
                camera.Front = saved_camera_front;
                camera.Yaw = saved_camera_yaw;
                camera.Pitch = saved_camera_pitch;
                camera.updateCameraVectors();
            }
            
            c_key_pressed = true;
        }
    } else {
        c_key_pressed = false;
    }
}
```

## 3. Update the Camera Position in the Render Loop

In the main render loop, add code to update the camera position when in avatar mode:

```cpp
// Add this inside the render loop before drawing anything
if (avatar_camera_mode) {
    // Position camera at avatar's position with appropriate height offset
    glm::vec3 avatar_position = baseAvatar.GetPosition();
    glm::vec3 avatar_direction = baseAvatar.GetDirection();
    
    // Set camera position slightly above avatar's head
    camera.Position = avatar_position + glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.5f, 0.0f);
    
    // Set camera to look in the direction the avatar is facing
    float avatar_rotation = glm::radians(baseAvatar.GetRotation());
    camera.Yaw = -avatar_rotation + 90.0f; // Convert avatar rotation to camera yaw
    camera.Pitch = 0.0f; // Reset pitch
    camera.updateCameraVectors();
}
```

## 4. Add Necessary Methods to the Avatar Class

You'll need to add these methods to your Avatar class to access the position and rotation:

```cpp
// Add to avatar.hpp inside public section:
glm::vec3 GetPosition() const { return position; }
float GetRotation() const { return current_rotation; }
```

## 5. Make updateCameraVectors Public

In camera.hpp, change the updateCameraVectors() method from private to public so we can call it when we manually change the camera's orientation.

```cpp
// In camera.hpp, move from private to public section:
void updateCameraVectors();
```

## Implementation Notes

1. This implementation toggles between two camera modes with the 'C' key
2. In avatar mode, the camera follows the avatar's position and direction
3. When switching back to normal mode, the camera returns to its previous state
4. You might want to disable regular camera controls when in avatar mode

This should give you a basic implementation of the feature you're looking for. You can refine it further by adjusting the camera offset or adding more advanced features like a third-person view option.
