hmamawal: @workspace tell me how the lighting works in this program

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationThe program sets up a single point light using a basic Phong‐style (or Blinn–Phong) lighting model. In [main.cpp](c:\Users\hunter.mamawal\Classes\CS473_Computer_Graphics\CS473_PROJECT2\main.cpp), you can see the light’s properties being defined and passed to the shader uniforms. For example:

----cpp
// Lighting parameters are defined as follows:
glm::vec3 light_color (1.0);
shader_program.setVec4("point_light.ambient", glm::vec4(0.1f * light_color, 1.0));
shader_program.setVec4("point_light.diffuse", glm::vec4(light_color, 1.0f));
shader_program.setVec4("point_light.specular", glm::vec4(0.5f * light_color, 1.0f));
shader_program.setVec4("point_light.position", light_position);
shader_program.setBool("point_light.on", true);

// Also, the camera (view) position is sent as:
shader_program.setVec4("view_position", glm::vec4(camera.Position, 1.0));
----cpp

Here's how it works:

• **Ambient Light:** A constant 10% of the light’s color gives a base illumination.

• **Diffuse Light:** Uses the full light color and is calculated based on the angle between the light direction and the surface normal.

• **Specular Light:** At 50% of the light’s color, this component creates highlights and is computed using both the light and view directions.

• **Light Position:** Set via the uniform "point_light.position" (from the global variable light_position) so that the shaders can compute the correct light vector.

• **View Position:** Updated every frame based on the camera’s current position to ensure specular highlights are correctly positioned.

The actual lighting calculations are done in the shader (with uniforms set via the [Shader](c:\Users\hunter.mamawal\Classes\CS473_Computer_Graphics\CS473_PROJECT2\classes\Shader.hpp) class and implemented in [Shader.cpp](c:\Users\hunter.mamawal\Classes\CS473_Computer_Graphics\CS473_PROJECT2\classes\Shader.cpp)).

hmamawal: how can i ensure that my point light illuminates the baseAvatar and the tumbling floor perfectly? some parts of these objects are in the shadows and i can't see them too well.

GitHub Copilot: You can adjust the light’s parameters so that even shadowed areas get enough illumination. For example, try increasing the ambient component, which is the constant filling light, or moving the light closer to your objects. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Increase Ambient Intensity:**  
   In main.cpp, change the ambient factor from 0.1 to a higher value (for example, 0.5) so that darker areas receive more light. For instance, update this line:

   ````cpp
   // filepath: c:\Users\hunter.mamawal\Classes\CS473_Computer_Graphics\CS473_PROJECT2\main.cpp
   shader_program.setVec4("point_light.ambient", glm::vec4(0.1f * light_color, 1.0));
   ````

   to something like:

   ````cpp
   // filepath: c:\Users\hunter.mamawal\Classes\CS473_Computer_Graphics\CS473_PROJECT2\main.cpp
   shader_program.setVec4("point_light.ambient", glm::vec4(0.5f * light_color, 1.0));
   ````

2. **Reposition the Light Source:**  
   Ensure that the light position is well placed relative to both the baseAvatar and the tumbling floor. If the light is too high or to the side, surfaces might fall into strong shadows. Try experimenting by moving light_position closer to the scene objects.

3. **Check Normals:**  
   If some surfaces are still too dark, verify that their normals are correct in your model data. Incorrect normals can cause the lighting calculation (especially the diffuse and specular components) to produce overly dark results.

4. **Supplementary Fill Lighting:**  
   If a single point light isn’t enough, consider adding an ambient fill light or a second light source to reduce harsh shadows.

These changes will help ensure that your point light illuminates your baseAvatar and tumbling floor more evenly, making even the shadowed areas visible.

hmamawal: how do i correct the Normals? how do i add ambient fill light? how do i know where to reposition the light source? I believe that my LouGrossBuilding Object may be blockign some of the light.

GitHub Copilot: 1. **Correcting Normals:**  
   • Verify that your models export correct normals from your 3D modeling software.  
   • In your vertex shader, you’re already transforming normals with  
   ````cpp
   norm = mat3(transpose(inverse(model * local))) * aNorm;
   ````  
   If the normals still appear off, try recalculating or re-exporting proper normals in your modeling tool.

2. **Adding Ambient Fill Light:**  
   • Increase the ambient intensity by raising the ambient component in your main.cpp. For example, change  
   ````cpp
   shader_program.setVec4("point_light.ambient", glm::vec4(0.5f * light_color, 1.0));
   ````  
   to something higher (e.g., 0.8f or 1.0f) to fill in shadows.  
   • Alternatively, you can add a second light source with full ambient contribution to act as a fill light.

3. **Repositioning the Light Source:**  
   • Experiment by modifying the light’s world position (the light_position variable). For example, try moving it higher or to a different lateral position.  
   • Use visual feedback—adjust the light position in small increments until you see even illumination on the baseAvatar and tumbling floor.  
   • If the LouGrossBuilding is blocking the light, reposition the light above or around it or consider adding additional light sources from different angles.

These changes should help improve the overall illumination in your scene.
