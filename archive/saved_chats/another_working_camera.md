hmamawal: #codebase  a camera view change if i pressed 'C' where the camera would become the location of hte avatar object and if i pressed 'C' again then the camera view would switch back to normal?

GitHub Copilot: I'll implement a camera view change feature that toggles between the normal view and a view from the avatar's perspective when the 'C' key is pressed. This will require several modifications to the code.

First, I'll examine what we need to understand about the current camera and avatar setup.Now I'll implement the camera view change feature when pressing 'C'. Based on my research, I need to:

1. Add a flag to track the current camera mode
2. Store the original camera position for returning to normal view
3. Modify ProcessInput to handle the 'C' key
4. Update the camera position and orientation based on the avatar's position

Let's make these changes:
````
//Global Variables
//----------------
//Screen width and height
const unsigned int SCR_WIDTH = 800;
const unsigned int SCR_HEIGHT = 800;

//clear color
glm::vec4 clear_color (0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);

//mouse variables
bool first_mouse{true};
float last_x{0.0};
float last_y{0.0};

//Camera Object
//set up the camera
Camera camera(glm::vec3(0.0f,1.0f,25.0f),glm::vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f),-90.0f,0.0f);
float delta_time{0.001};
float last_frame{0.0};

//Camera mode flag for toggling between normal and avatar view
bool avatar_camera_mode = false;
glm::vec3 original_camera_position(0.0f, 1.0f, 25.0f);
float original_camera_yaw = -90.0f;
float original_camera_pitch = 0.0f;
bool c_key_pressed = false;

//location of the point light
glm::vec4 light_position (0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0);
````


Made changes.

Now I'll add the functionality to switch camera modes when 'C' is pressed. Let's modify the ProcessInput function to handle this camera toggle:
````
// process all input: query GLFW whether relevant keys are pressed/released this frame and react accordingly
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void ProcessInput(GLFWwindow *window)
{
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE) == GLFW_PRESS)
        glfwSetWindowShouldClose(window, true);

    // Toggle camera view when 'C' is pressed (only once per keypress)
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_C) == GLFW_PRESS) {
        if (!c_key_pressed) {
            c_key_pressed = true;
            avatar_camera_mode = !avatar_camera_mode;

            // Save original camera position when switching to avatar camera
            if (avatar_camera_mode) {
                original_camera_position = camera.Position;
                original_camera_yaw = camera.Yaw;
                original_camera_pitch = camera.Pitch;
            } else {
                // Restore the original camera position when switching back to normal view
                camera.Position = original_camera_position;
                camera.Yaw = original_camera_yaw;
                camera.Pitch = original_camera_pitch;
                camera.updateCameraVectors();
            }
        }
    } else {
        c_key_pressed = false;
    }

    if (glfwGetKey(window,GLFW_KEY_W)==GLFW_PRESS) {
        camera.ProcessKeyboard(FORWARD,delta_time);
    }

    if (glfwGetKey(window,GLFW_KEY_S)==GLFW_PRESS) {
        camera.ProcessKeyboard(BACKWARD,delta_time);
    }

    if (glfwGetKey(window,GLFW_KEY_A)==GLFW_PRESS) {
        camera.ProcessKeyboard(LEFT,delta_time);
    }

    if (glfwGetKey(window,GLFW_KEY_D)==GLFW_PRESS) {
        camera.ProcessKeyboard(RIGHT,delta_time);
    }
}

Made changes.

Now we need to make a few more modifications to implement the camera view change functionality. We need to update the camera position to match the avatar's position in every frame when in avatar camera mode.

Let's modify Camera class to make the updateCameraVectors method public so we can call it when adjusting the camera to the avatar's view:

Now we need to add a way to access the avatar's position from the main render loop. Let's add accessor methods to the Avatar class to get the position and rotation information.

Now that I've set up the necessary infrastructure for toggling between camera views, let's add the code to update the camera's position and orientation based on the avatar's position in each frame. This will create a first-person view when in avatar camera mode.

                float extraHeight = baseAvatar.IsFlipping() ? baseAvatar.GetFlipHeight() : 0.0f;
                camera.Position = glm::vec3(avatarPos.x, avatarPos.y + 2.0f + extraHeight, avatarPos.z);

Made changes.

I've implemented a camera view toggle feature that lets you switch between the normal view and the avatar's perspective by pressing the 'C' key. Here's what I did:

1. Added a toggle flag to track the current camera mode and variables to store the original camera position when switching modes.

2. Updated the `ProcessInput` function to handle the 'C' key press, which toggles between normal and avatar view.

3. Made the `updateCameraVectors` function in the Camera class public so we can update the camera orientation when switching views.

4. Added getter methods to the Avatar class to access its position and rotation data.

5. Added code in the render loop to update the camera position and orientation to match the avatar's position when in avatar view mode.

Now when you press 'C':
- The camera will switch to the avatar's perspective, positioned at the avatar's eye level
- The camera will move and rotate with the avatar, creating a first-person view
- Camera controls like WASD movement will still work in both modes
- The camera will even follow the flipping motion if the avatar performs a flip (press 'B' to flip)
- Press 'C' again to return to the original camera position and orientation

The avatar view provides an immersive first-person perspective, while the normal view gives you a broader overview of the scene. This gives you flexibility in how you navigate and observe the environment.

You can try it out by building and running the program. Use the arrow keys to move the avatar and press 'C' to toggle between camera views.

hmamawal: #problems:avatar.cpp i got an error when compiling

GitHub Copilot: I see the problem. There's a redefinition of the `GetJumpHeight()` method in the `avatar.cpp` file. This is happening because we added a similar getter function in the avatar.hpp header file but there's already one defined in the avatar.cpp file. Let's fix this issue.I see the issue now. There's a conflict between the `GetJumpHeight()` method defined in both the avatar.hpp header file and the avatar.cpp implementation file. The error occurs because we have:

1. In avatar.hpp (line 30): `float GetJumpHeight() const { return jump_height; }`
2. In avatar.cpp (line 102): Another implementation of the same method

Let's fix this by removing the duplicate implementation in avatar.cpp:
````
void Avatar::Draw(Shader *shader, bool use_shader) {
    if (use_shader) {
        shader->use();
    }
    glm::mat4 local(1.0);
    local = glm::translate(local, this->position);
    
    // Add vertical offset for jump
    if (is_flipping) {
        local = glm::translate(local, glm::vec3(0.0f, flip_height, 0.0f));
        
        // Start rotation only after initial rise (20% into animation)
        // Complete rotation before landing (90% of animation)
        if (flip_progress > 0.2f && flip_progress < 0.9f) {
            // Map 0.2-0.9 range to 0-1 for rotation progress
            float rotation_progress = (flip_progress - 0.2f) / 0.7f;
            // Apply faster rotation in middle of jump
            local = glm::rotate(local, glm::radians(rotation_progress * 360.0f), glm::vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
        } else if (flip_progress >= 0.9f) {
            // Keep final rotation
            local = glm::rotate(local, glm::radians(360.0f), glm::vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
        }
    }
    
    local = glm::rotate(local, glm::radians(this->current_rotation), glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0));
    local = glm::rotate(local, glm::radians(this->initial_rotation), glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0));
    local = glm::scale(local, this->scale);
    shader->setMat4("local", local);
    shader->setInt("shader_state", this->shader_state);
    this->body.Draw();
}

Avatar::~Avatar() {
    this->body.DeallocateShape();
}

Made changes.

Looking at the code, I've successfully resolved the error. The issue was that we had a duplicate definition of the `GetJumpHeight()` method - one in the header file and another in the implementation file. 

I've removed the duplicate implementation from avatar.cpp, keeping only the inline definition in the header file. The project should now compile correctly without the redefinition error.

Now you'll need to fix a small reference to this field in the main.cpp file because we can't directly access `jump_height` since it's protected. Let's update the main.cpp file to use the getter method:
````
            // If the avatar is flipping, adjust the pitch to look in the direction of the flip
            if (baseAvatar.IsFlipping()) {
                float flipProgress = baseAvatar.GetFlipHeight() / baseAvatar.GetJumpHeight();
                if (flipProgress > 0.2f && flipProgress < 0.9f) {
                    // Map 0.2-0.9 range to 0-360 for rotation during flip
                    float flipRotation = ((flipProgress - 0.2f) / 0.7f) * 360.0f;
                    camera.Pitch = -flipRotation; // Negative because we're flipping forward
                    // Clamp pitch to prevent camera from going upside down
                    if (camera.Pitch < -89.0f) camera.Pitch = -89.0f;
                    if (camera.Pitch > 89.0f) camera.Pitch = 89.0f;
                }
            }
````


Made changes.

Now let's build the project to verify the fix:

hmamawal: that worked, except i want the camera view to rotate with the avatar as it flips as well. it seems that the camera simply looks downward instead of rotating

GitHub Copilot: I understand the issue. Currently, the camera is only changing its pitch when the avatar flips, but it's not fully rotating with the avatar during the flip. Let's enhance the implementation to make the camera truly rotate with the avatar as it flips, creating a more immersive first-person flip experience.
````
            // Update camera position based on avatar if in avatar camera mode
            if (avatar_camera_mode) {

I've implemented a more immersive rotating camera effect for the avatar's flips. Now when your character flips (by pressing 'B'), the camera will truly rotate with the avatar, creating a realistic first-person view of the flip.

Here's what the new implementation does:

1. When the avatar is flipping, the camera now follows a circular rotation path around the avatar's head.

2. I'm using sine and cosine functions to calculate the camera's position offset, creating a smooth circular movement that matches the rotation of the avatar during the flip.

3. The camera's pitch is adjusted continuously throughout the flip rotation, allowing it to complete a full 360-degree rotation.

4. I've added special handling for the pitch angles to prevent the camera from getting stuck in invalid states, ensuring smooth transitions between normal view and the rotating flip view.

5. To fine-tune the experience, I'm using a small rotation radius (0.2) to keep the camera close to the avatar's head, creating a more believable first-person effect.

This implementation should provide a much more immersive experience when flipping. Try it out by:

1. Press 'C' to enter avatar camera mode
2. Press 'B' to make your avatar flip
3. Watch how the camera rotates with the avatar through the full flip

The camera will smoothly return to normal position after the flip is complete, while maintaining the first-person perspective.
