GitHub Copilot: # Setting Up a Depth Map Framebuffer for Shadow Mapping

To set up a depth map framebuffer to store depth information for shadow mapping, you'll need to add some code just before your render loop. Here's how to implement this:

```cpp
// Just before the render loop, after SetupRendering()
// Define constants for the shadow map resolution
const unsigned int SHADOW_WIDTH = 2048; 
const unsigned int SHADOW_HEIGHT = 2048;

// a. Define and generate the framebuffer
unsigned int depthMapFBO;
glGenFramebuffers(1, &depthMapFBO);

// b. Define and generate a 2D texture for depth information
unsigned int depthMap;
glGenTextures(1, &depthMap);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, depthMap);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, 
             SHADOW_WIDTH, SHADOW_HEIGHT, 0, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_FLOAT, NULL);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER);
float borderColor[] = { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f };
glTexParameterfv(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR, borderColor);

// c. Bind the framebuffer and attach the texture
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, depthMapFBO);
glFramebufferTexture2D(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, GL_TEXTURE_2D, depthMap, 0);

// d. Set draw and read buffers to none since we only need depth
glDrawBuffer(GL_NONE);
glReadBuffer(GL_NONE);

// Check if the framebuffer is complete
if (glCheckFramebufferStatus(GL_FRAMEBUFFER) != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE) {
    std::cout << "Framebuffer is not complete!" << std::endl;
}

// Unbind the framebuffer
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);

std::cout << "Shadow mapping depth framebuffer setup complete" << std::endl;

// Existing code continues with the render loop...
std::cout << "Entering render loop..." << std::endl;
static int frame_count = 0;
```

This code should be placed after your `SetupRendering()` call and before the render loop begins. 

Later in your rendering code, you'll need to:

1. Render the scene from the light's perspective to the depth map
2. Switch back to the default framebuffer and render the scene normally
3. Use the depth map as a texture when calculating shadows

Let me know if you need help implementing those parts of the shadow mapping pipeline as well.

hmamawal: #codebase now tell me how to accomplish this (just simploy tell me how to accomplish this 1 part of my instructions, not how to fully implement shadows. i'm getting there but not yet): <<< you will either need to create your own depth vertex and fragment shaders or add a new
shader state for depth rendering. These are relatively straight forward and store the depth
information. You can follow the procedure from the www.learnopengl.com tutorial. A uniform
for the lightSpaceMatrix is used to provide the transformations needed to determine the
fragment position from the lightâ€™s point of view>>> opengl context: <<<Render to depth map
When we render the scene from the light's perspective we'd much rather use a simple shader that only transforms the vertices to light space and not much more. For such a simple shader called simpleDepthShader we'll use the following vertex shader:


#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;

uniform mat4 lightSpaceMatrix;
uniform mat4 model;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = lightSpaceMatrix * model * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
}  
This vertex shader takes a per-object model, a vertex, and transforms all vertices to light space using lightSpaceMatrix.

Since we have no color buffer and disabled the draw and read buffers, the resulting fragments do not require any processing so we can simply use an empty fragment shader:


#version 330 core

void main()
{             
    // gl_FragDepth = gl_FragCoord.z;
}  
This empty fragment shader does no processing whatsoever, and at the end of its run the depth buffer is updated. We could explicitly set the depth by uncommenting its one line, but this is effectively what happens behind the scene anyways.

Rendering the depth/shadow map now effectively becomes:


simpleDepthShader.use();
glUniformMatrix4fv(lightSpaceMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(lightSpaceMatrix));

glViewport(0, 0, SHADOW_WIDTH, SHADOW_HEIGHT);
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, depthMapFBO);
    glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
    RenderScene(simpleDepthShader);
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);  
Here the RenderScene function takes a shader program, calls all relevant drawing functions and sets the corresponding model matrices where necessary.

The result is a nicely filled depth buffer holding the closest depth of each visible fragment from the light's perspective. By rendering this texture onto a 2D quad that fills the screen (similar to what we did in the post-processing section at the end of the framebuffers chapter) we get something like this:

Depth (or shadow) map of shadow mapping technique
For rendering the depth map onto a quad we used the following fragment shader:


#version 330 core
out vec4 FragColor;
  
in vec2 TexCoords;

uniform sampler2D depthMap;

void main()
{             
    float depthValue = texture(depthMap, TexCoords).r;
    FragColor = vec4(vec3(depthValue), 1.0);
}  
Note that there are some subtle changes when displaying depth using a perspective projection matrix instead of an orthographic projection matrix as depth is non-linear when using perspective projection. At the end of this chapter we'll discuss some of these subtle differences.

You can find the source code for rendering a scene to a depth map here.>>>

GitHub Copilot: # Creating Depth Shaders for Shadow Mapping

To create the necessary depth vertex and fragment shaders for shadow mapping, follow these steps:

## 1. Create Depth Shader Files

You need to create two new shader files in your shaders directory:

### Depth Vertex Shader
```cpp
#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;

uniform mat4 lightSpaceMatrix;
uniform mat4 model;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = lightSpaceMatrix * model * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
}
```

### Depth Fragment Shader
```cpp
#version 330 core

void main()
{
    // Empty fragment shader - depth will be written automatically
}
```

## 2. Add Global Shader Pointer

Add a global variable for the depth shader:

```cpp
// At the top with your other shader pointers
Shader* depth_shader_ptr = nullptr;
```

## 3. Load and Initialize the Shader

In your initialization code, add code to load this new shader:

```cpp
// Add to your CreateShaders function or create a separate function
void CreateDepthShader(Shader*& depth_shader) {
    depth_shader = new Shader("shaders/depthVertexShader.glsl", "shaders/depthFragmentShader.glsl");
    if (depth_shader == nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Failed to create depth shader" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Depth shader created successfully" << std::endl;
    }
}

// Then call this after your other shader initializations:
CreateDepthShader(depth_shader_ptr);
```

## 4. Clean Up the Shader

Don't forget to add cleanup code for the depth shader:

```cpp
// In your cleanup section
if (depth_shader_ptr != nullptr) {
    delete depth_shader_ptr;
    depth_shader_ptr = nullptr;
}
```

This completes the setup of the depth shaders that will be used for shadow mapping. These shaders are intentionally simple since their only purpose is to record depth values from the light's perspective.

hmamawal: #codebase now tell me how to carry out this instruction (just simploy tell me how to accomplish this 1 part of my instructions, not how to fully implement shadows. i'm getting there but not yet): <<<Create your light's point of view inside the render loop. These steps are also similar to the
tutorial, but I recommend using the following for light orthographic projection (-100 to 100 for
left/right and top/bottom, and -10 near and 150.0 far setting). For the light position needed for
the orthographic view use 100.0 times the negative of the directional light>>> here is what i think the relevent learnopengl webiste has to offer on this part: <<<Light space transform
An unknown in the previous snippet of code is the ConfigureShaderAndMatrices function. In the second pass this is business as usual: make sure proper projection and view matrices are set, and set the relevant model matrices per object. However, in the first pass we need to use a different projection and view matrix to render the scene from the light's point of view.

Because we're modelling a directional light source, all its light rays are parallel. For this reason, we're going to use an orthographic projection matrix for the light source where there is no perspective deform:


float near_plane = 1.0f, far_plane = 7.5f;
glm::mat4 lightProjection = glm::ortho(-10.0f, 10.0f, -10.0f, 10.0f, near_plane, far_plane);  
Here is an example orthographic projection matrix as used in this chapter's demo scene. Because a projection matrix indirectly determines the range of what is visible (e.g. what is not clipped) you want to make sure the size of the projection frustum correctly contains the objects you want to be in the depth map. When objects or fragments are not in the depth map they will not produce shadows.

To create a view matrix to transform each object so they're visible from the light's point of view, we're going to use the infamous glm::lookAt function; this time with the light source's position looking at the scene's center.


glm::mat4 lightView = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3(-2.0f, 4.0f, -1.0f), 
                                  glm::vec3( 0.0f, 0.0f,  0.0f), 
                                  glm::vec3( 0.0f, 1.0f,  0.0f));  
Combining these two gives us a light space transformation matrix that transforms each world-space vector into the space as visible from the light source; exactly what we need to render the depth map.


glm::mat4 lightSpaceMatrix = lightProjection * lightView; 
This lightSpaceMatrix is the transformation matrix that we earlier denoted as T
. With this lightSpaceMatrix, we can render the scene as usual as long as we give each shader the light-space equivalents of the projection and view matrices. However, we only care about depth values and not all the expensive fragment (lighting) calculations. To save performance we're going to use a different, but much simpler shader for rendering to the depth map.>>>

GitHub Copilot: # Creating a Light's Point of View in the Render Loop

To create the light's point of view inside your render loop for shadow mapping, you need to construct a light space transformation matrix that will transform scene objects into the light's perspective. Here's how to accomplish this specific part:

## Add the Light Space Matrix Calculation

Add the following code at the beginning of your render loop, right after your current frame time calculation:

```cpp
// Create light space transformation matrix
// 1. Create a position for the light source based on the negative direction vector
glm::vec3 lightPos = -100.0f * glm::vec3(light_direction.x, light_direction.y, light_direction.z);

// 2. Create the light view matrix - looking from light position toward the scene origin
glm::mat4 lightView = glm::lookAt(
    lightPos,              // Light position
    glm::vec3(0.0f),       // Look at scene center
    glm::vec3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)  // Up vector
);

// 3. Create the orthographic projection matrix with your specified dimensions
float near_plane = -10.0f;
float far_plane = 150.0f;
glm::mat4 lightProjection = glm::ortho(
    -100.0f, 100.0f,       // Left, right
    -100.0f, 100.0f,       // Bottom, top
    near_plane, far_plane  // Near, far
);

// 4. Create the combined light space matrix
glm::mat4 lightSpaceMatrix = lightProjection * lightView;

// 5. Set the light space matrix uniform in your depth shader
depth_shader_ptr->use();
depth_shader_ptr->setMat4("lightSpaceMatrix", lightSpaceMatrix);
```

This code:
1. Creates a light position by multiplying the negative of your directional light by 100.0
2. Creates a view matrix from the light's perspective looking toward the scene origin
3. Sets up an orthographic projection with your specified dimensions
4. Combines these into the lightSpaceMatrix that will transform world coordinates to light space
5. Sets this matrix in your depth shader

Place this code before your current depth rendering code in the render loop. The lightSpaceMatrix will be used when rendering the scene from the light's perspective to create the shadow map.

hmamawal: how do i Set the shader program lightSpaceMatrix to this matrix value that we just calculated?

GitHub Copilot: # Setting the lightSpaceMatrix in Your Shader Program

You've already added code to set the lightSpaceMatrix in your depth shader:

```cpp
// 5. Set the light space matrix uniform in your depth shader
depth_shader_ptr->use();
depth_shader_ptr->setMat4("lightSpaceMatrix", lightSpaceMatrix);
```

But you also need to set this matrix in your main shader program so it can use the shadow mapping information. Add this code:

```cpp
// Set lightSpaceMatrix in your main shader program as well
shader_program_ptr->use();
shader_program_ptr->setMat4("lightSpaceMatrix", lightSpaceMatrix);
```

This assumes your main shader has a uniform variable called `lightSpaceMatrix`. If your main fragment shader uses a different name for this uniform, replace "lightSpaceMatrix" with the appropriate variable name.

Make sure to add this after calculating the `lightSpaceMatrix` but before your main rendering calls.

hmamawal: #codebase now: <<<set up the code for two passes. Paste a copy of all the render code that renders the shapes

a. Set the glViewport to 0,0 and width and height you set up for your texture (it is okay if
these do not match the screen size...actually preferred that they don't).
b. Bind your depth map framebuffer.
c. Render your scene using the depth map. This requires a little finesse. Make sure you
are using your depth shader if you made one (or setting shader state to render to
depth). The current Avatar sets the shader_state in its own draw function so you either
need to remove that or add a parameter to the Avatar::Draw to override its default

GitHub Copilot: # Setting Up Two Render Passes for Shadow Mapping

Here's how to modify your render loop to support two passes - one for depth map creation and one for normal rendering:

```cpp
// In the render loop, after setting the lightSpaceMatrix:

// FIRST PASS - Render to depth map
// Set viewport to shadow map dimensions
glViewport(0, 0, SHADOW_WIDTH, SHADOW_HEIGHT);
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, depthMapFBO);
glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

// Use depth shader for shadow mapping
depth_shader_ptr->use();
depth_shader_ptr->setMat4("lightSpaceMatrix", lightSpaceMatrix);

// Render the scene for depth map

    point_light_color,
    light_direction
);

// SECOND PASS - Regular rendering to screen
// Reset viewport to screen dimensions
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);
glViewport(0, 0, SCR_WIDTH, SCR_HEIGHT);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

    camera.Position.y = 0.5;
}

// Display text
renderText(font_program_ptr, arial_font, camera);
```

**Note:** Your renderScene function may need to be modified to handle the depth shader case properly. You can either:

1. Create a separate renderSceneDepth function that doesn't apply textures
2. Add a parameter to renderScene to specify if it's doing a depth pass
3. Check the current shader type in renderScene and adjust behavior accordingly

Remember that when rendering for the depth map, you only need positions - no need for textures and complex fragment shading.

hmamawal: #codebase now: <<< The original pass is the 'second' pass of the scene, but it still doesn't use the shadow
information. This requires a few important steps.
a. Add a uniform (mat4) for the light space matrix transformation to your vertex shader

Within main, set this output to the value of multiplying the uniform in part a to the
fragment position (model * local * position).
c. Add an input (vec4) for the item above (SAME NAME) to the fragment shader.

how it works (set bias to zero to start with).
1. Gets the fragment location from the light's perspective.
2. Determines where that is in the texture.
3. Compares the depth of the current fragment to the depth value in the

what's in the depth map, then this fragment is occluded from the light.

GitHub Copilot: # Adding Shadow Calculation to Your Vertex and Fragment Shaders

Here's how to modify your shaders to account for shadow effects:

## 1. Modify Vertex Shader (vertex.glsl)

Add a uniform for the light space matrix and an output for fragment position in light space:

```cpp
// Add these lines with your other uniforms
uniform mat4 lightSpaceMatrix;

// Add this with your other outputs
out vec4 FragPosLightSpace;

void main()
{
  // Your existing code...
  
  // Add this line before gl_Position calculation
  FragPosLightSpace = lightSpaceMatrix * model * local * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
  
  // Rest of your existing code...
}
```

## 2. Modify Fragment Shader (fragment.glsl)

Add corresponding input and shadow calculation function:

```cpp
// Add with your other inputs
in vec4 FragPosLightSpace;

// Add with your other uniforms
uniform sampler2D shadow_map;

// Add this function before your main function
float ShadowCalculation(vec4 fragPosLightSpace, float bias)
{
    // Perform perspective divide
    vec3 projCoords = fragPosLightSpace.xyz / fragPosLightSpace.w;
    
    // Transform to [0,1] range
    projCoords = projCoords * 0.5 + 0.5;
    
    // Get closest depth value from light's perspective
    float closestDepth = texture(shadow_map, projCoords.xy).r; 
    
    // Get depth of current fragment from light's perspective
    float currentDepth = projCoords.z;
    
    // Check whether current fragment is in shadow
    float shadow = currentDepth - bias > closestDepth ? 1.0 : 0.0;

    // Keep shadows within the light's far plane bounds
    if(projCoords.z > 1.0)
        shadow = 0.0;
        
    return shadow;
}

void main()
{
    // Your existing code...
    
    // When calculating directional light, modify your code to use the shadow factor
    float bias = 0.005; // Start with a small bias
    float shadow = ShadowCalculation(FragPosLightSpace, bias);
    
    // Use shadow in your lighting calculations
    // For example, if you have something like:
    // vec3 directional = directional_light_calculation();
    // 
    // Change it to:
    // vec3 directional = directional_light_calculation() * (1.0 - shadow);
    
    // Rest of your existing code...
}
```

This implements the basic shadow calculation logic where:
1. The vertex shader transforms vertices to light space coordinates
2. The fragment shader compares the current fragment's depth against the stored depth map
3. A shadow factor is calculated and applied to reduce lighting for shadows

Make sure your main shader is properly binding the shadow map to texture unit 1 and setting the `shadow_map` uniform, which you're already doing in your render loop.

GitHub Copilot: # Managing Multiple Textures with Shadow Mapping

To properly set up your shader program for the second pass while handling multiple textures and the shadow map, you need to make these modifications:

## In Your Main Render Loop (Second Pass)

```cpp
// SECOND PASS - Regular rendering to screen
// Reset viewport to screen dimensions
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0);
glViewport(0, 0, SCR_WIDTH, SCR_HEIGHT);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

// Make sure you're using the main shader program
shader_program_ptr->use();

// Set the lightSpaceMatrix uniform in the shader
shader_program_ptr->setMat4("lightSpaceMatrix", lightSpaceMatrix);

// Assign the shadow map to texture unit 1
// IMPORTANT: Don't use texture unit 0 as it's likely used by your model textures
shader_program_ptr->setInt("shadow_map", 1);
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, depthMap);

// Your model textures will use GL_TEXTURE0 by default
// No need to explicitly set that here if your renderScene function handles it properly

// Your other rendering code...
```

## Key Modifications for Multiple Textures

1. **Consistent Texture Units**: Make sure your shadow map always uses texture unit 1 and your model textures use other units (starting from 0)

2. **Texture Management in renderScene Function**: In your rendering function, you'll need to be careful about how textures are activated and bound:

   ```cpp
   // Inside your renderScene function when binding textures
   glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);  // For the first model texture
   glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, yourTextureID);
   // After using the model texture
   glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE1);  // Reset back to the shadow map
   glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, depthMap);
   ```

3. **After Rendering**: Always reset to texture unit 0 when done:

   ```cpp
   // After rendering everything
   glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
   ```

These modifications ensure that both your regular textures and shadow map can coexist without interfering with each other. Since you're already doing most of this in your code, the main thing is to be consistent with which texture unit is used for what purpose and make sure you reset after using specific textures.

hmamawal: i recall you mentioning this earlier: <<<Note: Your renderScene function may need to be modified to handle the depth shader case properly. You can either:

1.Create a separate renderSceneDepth function that doesn't apply textures
2.Add a parameter to renderScene to specify if it's doing a depth pass
3.Check the current shader type in renderScene and adjust behavior accordingly>>> currently, some of my textures are not being appropriately assigned to the correct assets. for example, the tumbling floor is being assigned the texture of one of my banners. are these suggestions you made connected? if so, which suggestion should i pursue?

GitHub Copilot: # Fixing Texture Assignment Issues with Shadow Mapping

Yes, the texture assignment issues you're experiencing are directly connected to the suggestions I made earlier. When you're rendering in two passes (first for the depth map, then for the final scene), texture units can get mixed up, especially when multiple models use different textures.

## Root Cause of Your Texture Issues

Your current code has two key problems:

1. **Texture Unit Conflicts**: When rendering the depth pass and then the regular pass, the texture units aren't being properly reset or managed between passes.

2. **Shader-Specific Rendering**: The `renderScene` function doesn't differentiate between regular rendering and depth-only rendering, which requires different texture handling.

## Best Solution for Your Case

Based on your code and the texture assignment issues, **option 2** is your best choice:

> Add a parameter to renderScene to specify if it's doing a depth pass

This will allow you to skip texture binding when rendering for the depth map while keeping your scene structure intact.

## Implementation Steps:

1. **Modify renderScene Function Signature**:

```cpp
void renderScene(Shader* shader_program, 
                GameModels& models, 
                Avatar& baseAvatar,
                AvatarHighBar* high_bar_avatar,
                const Camera& camera,
                const glm::vec3& light_color,
                const glm::vec4& light_direction,
                bool is_depth_pass = false) {
```

2. **Add Conditional Logic for Texture Binding**:

```cpp
// When binding textures, add a condition:
if (!is_depth_pass) {
    // For the vault table
    for (int i = 0; i < models.vault_table_textures.size(); i++) {
        glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + i);
        std::string texture_string = "textures[" + std::to_string(i) + "]";
        shader_program->setInt(texture_string, i);
        glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, models.vault_table_textures[i]);
    }
}
models.vault_table.Draw();
if (!is_depth_pass) {
    glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0); // Reset active texture
}
```

3. **Update Your Render Loop Calls**:

```cpp
// In your main.cpp - First Pass
renderScene(
    depth_shader_ptr,
    models,
    baseAvatar,
    high_bar_avatar,
    camera,
    point_light_color,
    light_direction,
    true  // This is a depth pass
);

// Second Pass
renderScene(
    shader_program_ptr,
    models,
    baseAvatar,
    high_bar_avatar,
    camera,
    point_light_color,
    light_direction,
    false  // This is a regular render pass
);
```

This approach maintains your existing rendering structure while preventing texture unit conflicts between the passes. For the depth pass, you'll only set positions and not waste time binding textures that aren't needed.

hmamawal: i made those changes, but currently, some of my textures are not being appropriately assigned to the correct assets. for example, the tumbling floor is being assigned the texture of one of my banners. why is this happening?

GitHub Copilot: # Fixing Texture Assignment Issues with Shadow Mapping

Looking at your code, I can see why your textures are getting mixed up. The issue appears to be in the way textures are being handled during the rendering passes. Let me explain the problem and provide a solution:

## Root Cause of the Texture Issue

1. **Texture Unit Management**: In your `renderScene` function, you've added the `is_depth_pass` parameter to skip texture binding for the vault table when doing a depth pass, but you haven't applied the same conditional logic for all other textures.

2. **Texture State Persistence**: When OpenGL binds a texture to a texture unit, that binding persists until something else changes it. When you skip binding textures during the depth pass, the previously bound textures remain active.

3. **Incomplete Reset**: After rendering objects, you reset active textures in some places but not consistently everywhere.

## The Solution

Here are the changes you need to make to fix the texture assignment issues:

1. **Add `is_depth_pass` Condition for All Texture Binding Operations**:

```cpp
void renderScene(Shader* shader_program, 
                GameModels& models, 
                Avatar& baseAvatar,
                AvatarHighBar* high_bar_avatar,
                const Camera& camera,
                const glm::vec3& light_color,
                const glm::vec4& light_direction,
                bool is_depth_pass) {
    
    // ...existing code...
    
    // For the floor
    shader_program->setInt("shader_state", TEXTURED);
    shader_program->setMat4("model", model);
    
    glm::mat4 floor_local(1.0);
    floor_local = glm::translate(floor_local, glm::vec3(0.0, 0.0, -0.01));
    shader_program->setMat4("local", floor_local);
    
    // Add condition for floor texture
    if (!is_depth_pass) {
        glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
        shader_program->setInt("textures[0]", 0);
        glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, models.floor_texture);
    }
    models.floor.Draw();
    
    // Draw tumbling floor
    shader_program->setInt("shader_state", IMPORTED_TEXTURED);
    glm::mat4 tumbling_floor_local(1.0);
    tumbling_floor_local = glm::translate(tumbling_floor_local, glm::vec3(0.0, 0.4, 0.0));
    shader_program->setMat4("model", identity);
    shader_program->setMat4("local", tumbling_floor_local);
    
    // Add condition for tumbling floor texture
    if (!is_depth_pass) {
        glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
        shader_program->setInt("textures[0]", 0);
        glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, models.tumbling_floor_texture);
    }
    models.tumbling_floor.Draw();
    
    // ... rest of the rendering code with similar pattern ...
    
    // Lou Gross Building
    if (!is_depth_pass) {
        // Bind building textures
        for (int i = 0; i < models.building_textures.size(); i++) {
            glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + i);
            std::string texture_string = "textures[" + std::to_string(i) + "]";
            shader_program->setInt(texture_string, i);
            glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, models.building_textures[i]);
        }
    }
    models.LouGrossBuilding.Draw();
    
    if (!is_depth_pass) {
        glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0); // Reset active texture
    }
    
    // ... continue for other objects ...
}
```

2. **Reset the Active Texture After Every Major Object**:

For each object that uses textures, make sure to reset the active texture afterward:

```cpp
// After rendering each textured object:
if (!is_depth_pass) {
    glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
}
```

3. **Modify Avatar Draw Method** (if your Avatar class binds textures internally):

If your Avatar class also binds textures in its Draw method, you'll need to modify it to accept the `is_depth_pass` parameter and skip texture binding during depth passes.

```cpp
// In Avatar.hpp:
void Draw(Shader* shader_program, bool is_spotlight_on, bool is_depth_pass = false);

// In Avatar.cpp:
void Avatar::Draw(Shader* shader_program, bool is_spotlight_on, bool is_depth_pass) {
    // ...existing code...
    
    if (!is_depth_pass) {
        // Bind textures only if not a depth pass
        // ...texture binding code...
    }
    
    // ...rendering code...
}
```

Then update your calls in renderScene:

```cpp
baseAvatar.Draw(shader_program, false, is_depth_pass);
high_bar_avatar->Draw(shader_program, false, is_depth_pass);
```

By making these changes, you'll ensure that:
1. Textures are only bound when necessary (not during depth pass)
2. Texture units are properly reset after each use
3. No texture state bleeds between different objects

This should resolve the issue of textures being incorrectly assigned to objects.

hmamawal: the texture issues are now fixed, but i'm wondering if i'm still missing anything because i cannot actually see any shadows in my scene.

GitHub Copilot: # Troubleshooting Missing Shadows in Your Scene

Looking at your code and shader files, I've identified several issues preventing shadows from appearing in your scene. Here's what you need to fix:

## 1. Missing Shadow Calculation in Fragment Shader

Your fragment shader has the `ShadowCalculation` function defined, but you're not actually using it in your lighting calculations. You need to:

```glsl
// Inside the CalcDirectionalLight function:
vec4 CalcDirectionalLight (DirectionalLight light, vec3 norm, vec3 frag, vec3 eye) {
    if (!light.on) {
        return vec4(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);
    }
    
    // Calculate shadow
    float bias = 0.005; // Adjust as needed
    float shadow = ShadowCalculation(FragPosLightSpace, bias);
    
    // Rest of your existing directional light calculation code
    vec3 light_direction = normalize(-light.direction.xyz);
    vec3 normal = normalize(norm);
    float diffuse_coeff = max(dot(normal,light_direction),0.0);
    
    vec3 view_direction = normalize(view_position.xyz-frag);
    vec3 reflect_direction = reflect(-light_direction,normal);
    float spec_coeff = pow(max(dot(view_direction,reflect_direction),0.0),256.0);
    
    // Apply shadow - multiply diffuse and specular components (not ambient)
    if ((fragment_shader_state == 2) || (fragment_shader_state == 3)) {
        return (light.ambient * vec4(ambient_color,opacity) 
                + (1.0 - shadow) * diffuse_coeff * light.diffuse * vec4(diffuse_color,opacity)
                + (1.0 - shadow) * spec_coeff * light.specular * vec4(specular_color,opacity));
    } else {
        return (light.ambient 
            + (1.0 - shadow) * diffuse_coeff * light.diffuse 
            + (1.0 - shadow) * spec_coeff * light.specular);
    }
}
```

## 2. Missing `shadow_map` Uniform in Fragment Shader

You have the declaration `uniform sampler2D shadow_map;` in your fragment shader, but if you have multiple texture units defined elsewhere in your shader, you'll need to make sure this doesn't conflict with your textures array.

## 3. Model Matrix Issue in Depth Shader

Your depth vertex shader is using just:
```glsl
uniform mat4 lightSpaceMatrix;
uniform mat4 model;

void main() {
    gl_Position = lightSpaceMatrix * model * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
}
```

But your main shader uses both model and local matrices:
```glsl
gl_Position = projection * view * model * local * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
```

For consistency, modify your depth shader to account for both model and local transforms:

```glsl
#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;

uniform mat4 lightSpaceMatrix;
uniform mat4 model;
uniform mat4 local;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = lightSpaceMatrix * model * local * vec4(aPos, 1.0);
}
```

## 4. Setting Local Matrix in Depth Shader

You need to set the local matrix in your depth shader before rendering:

```cpp
// In your renderScene function when using the depth shader:
depth_shader_ptr->use();
depth_shader_ptr->setMat4("lightSpaceMatrix", lightSpaceMatrix);
depth_shader_ptr->setMat4("model", model);
depth_shader_ptr->setMat4("local", local_matrix);
```

## 5. Debug the Shadow Map

To see if your shadow map is being correctly generated, add a debug mode:

```glsl
// Add to fragment shader
uniform bool debug_shadows = false;

// In main()
if (debug_shadows) {
    vec3 projCoords = FragPosLightSpace.xyz / FragPosLightSpace.w;
    projCoords = projCoords * 0.5 + 0.5;
    float closestDepth = texture(shadow_map, projCoords.xy).r; 
    FragColor = vec4(vec3(closestDepth), 1.0);
    return;
}
```

Then in your C++ code:
```cpp
// Enable for debugging, disable for normal rendering
shader_program_ptr->setBool("debug_shadows", true);
```

## 6. Adjust Light Direction and Bias

Try changing your light direction to cast more obvious shadows:
```cpp
// Try a more overhead light
light_direction = glm::vec4(0.0, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0);
```

And adjust the bias value in ShadowCalculation to prevent shadow acne:
```glsl
float bias = max(0.05 * (1.0 - dot(norm, lightDir)), 0.005);
```

By implementing these fixes, you should start seeing shadows in your scene. The most critical issue is likely that you have the shadow calculation function but aren't applying its results to modify your lighting.
